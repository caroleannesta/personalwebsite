					<h3>Music</h3>

					<h3>Design</h3>
						<p>↬ I love design, especially in the fashion and interior industries. I am obsessed with Zaha HADID work, because of its complexity, its lightness and curves. Also because she is a woman and has designed the CMA CGM tour in Marseille !</p>

					<h3>Self Development</h3>
						<p>↬ I am kind of a spiritual person, and i am convinced that we can change who we are thanks to self development and beliefs. Our brain can be modified as we reprogram our subconscious. 
				I find this topic <strong>really</strong> interesting, i love watching videos and read books about it.</p>

					<h3>Dance</h3>
						<p>↬ I have practiced dance for 14 years at the Site Pablo Picasso Conservatoire from Martigues. I was in a sport-study program. Thanks to dance i learn how to be competitive and work together in a group.</p>
